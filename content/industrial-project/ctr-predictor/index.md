This project focused on improving the Click-through Rate (CTR) predictor at Knorex, a core element in optimizing ad campaign performance for advertisers. By utilizing model calibration and continual learning, I enhanced the accuracy and adaptability of the CTR prediction system. Due to the confidential nature of the work, specific details of the implementation will not be discussed. This result achieved a significant improvement in revenue and performance of the platform, which was highlighted on the official company website.
