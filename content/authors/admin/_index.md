## Welcome to my personal page

My research interests focus on Computer Vision, particularly at the intersection of generative models, human-centric understanding, and visual learning. I am currently exploring PhD opportunities where I can contribute to these or related areas.

## Background

I am pursuing the [Master in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) program (2024–2025) at UAB, UOC, UPC, UPF, and UB in Barcelona, Spain. My current research for the Msc Thesis (Apr – Sep 2025) focuses on the reverse problem of Virtual Try-On: generating original clean garment images from try-on outputs. This involves disentangling clothing appearance from the person and restoring garment details, leveraging controllable generative models and human pose constraints understanding. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Sergio Escalara](https://sergioescalera.com/#intro) and [Dr. Meysam Madadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWMXdg4AAAAJ&hl=en), as part of [the Human Pose Recovery and Behavior Analysis group](https://www.cvc.uab.es/research-lines/hupba/).

Previously, I was a Research Fellow Intern at the [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/about-us/) under the supervision of Prof. [Daniel Ponsa](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7330-6524), where I worked on Image Super-Resolution and its adaptation for satellite imagery (Nov 2024 – Mar 2025).

Before entering academia, I spent over four years in industry. Most recently, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Knorex R&D Labs](https://www.knorex.com/research-and-development) (Jan 2022 – Oct 2024), specializing in programmatic advertising, user response prediction, ads ranking, and continual learning. I was advised there by [Yiping Jin](https://yipingnus.github.io/). Earlier, I was a core AI engineer at the U.S.-based startup SceneSeer (2019–2021), where I helped develop products in scene understanding and OCR.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics from [HCMUTE](https://fme.hcmute.edu.vn/ArticleId/bffdb6e0-12cc-4263-921f-c1e0f72cdfb5/introduction-to-mechatronics-department), Vietnam, where my thesis focused on image classification, CNN visual explanation, and real-time integration with mechatronic systems.
