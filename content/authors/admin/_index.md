**About me**

I am currently pursueing a [Joint Master's degree in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) at UAB, UOC, UPC, UPF, UB in Barcelona, Spain.

Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Knorex R&D Labs](https://www.knorex.com/research-and-development) - a US-based advertising platform, where I specialized in Applied Data Science, Machine Learning and Programmatic Advertising. Before that, I was one of three core AI engineers at [SceneSeer](https://www.youtube.com/@sceneseer8871) - another US-based startup focused on Computer Vision technology and application.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from [HCMUTE](https://fme.hcmute.edu.vn/ArticleId/bffdb6e0-12cc-4263-921f-c1e0f72cdfb5/introduction-to-mechatronics-department), where my thesis work focused on lightweight image classification, neural network interpretation and the integration with mechatronics system in real time.

**Research Interest**

* Computer Vision, Behavioral Analysis, Scene Understanding, Object tracking

* Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Model Calibration, Continual Learning
