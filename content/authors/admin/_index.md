## Welcome to my personal page
**[NEWS]** I'm excited to share that I am conducting my Msc Thesis in [Human Pose Recovery and Behavior Analysis group](https://www.cvc.uab.es/research-lines/hupba/) with [Professor Sergio Escalara](https://sergioescalera.com/#intro) and [Dr. Meysam Madadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWMXdg4AAAAJ&hl=en). I work on the topic of Virtual Try-on and Image Generative Model.

## About me

I am currently a student of the program [Master in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) at UAB, UOC, UPC, UPF, UB in Barcelona, Spain.

I was a Research Fellow Intern at [Computer Vision Center](https://www.cvc.uab.es/about-us/) supervised by Professor [Daniel Ponsa](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7330-6524) from November 2024 to March 2025. I worked primarily on Image Super-Resolution and its adaptation capability on satelite images.

In industry, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Knorex R&D Labs](https://www.knorex.com/research-and-development), where I was advised by [Yiping Jin](https://yipingnus.github.io/). My specialization here was Programmatic Advertising, Ads Ranking, User Response Prediction and Continual Learning. Before joining Knorex, I was a core AI engineers at the US-based startup [SceneSeer](https://www.youtube.com/@sceneseer8871), focused on Scene Understanding and OCR.

I hold a BE in Mechatronics from [HCMUTE](https://fme.hcmute.edu.vn/ArticleId/bffdb6e0-12cc-4263-921f-c1e0f72cdfb5/introduction-to-mechatronics-department), Viet Nam, where my thesis focused on Image Classification, CNN Visual Explanation and Real-time Integration with Mechatronics System.
