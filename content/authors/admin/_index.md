## About Me

I am currently pursueing a [Joint Master's degree in Computer Vision](https://mcv.uab.cat/) at UAB, UOC, UPC, UPF, UB in Barcelona, Spain.

Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Knorex R&D Labs](https://www.knorex.com/research-and-development) - a research division of Knorex, an advertising management and execution platform. At Knorex R&D Labs, I specialized in Programmatic Advertising utilizing Machine Learning and Data Science, with my favorite topic being Continual Learning in industrial context. 

Before that, I was one of three core AI engineers at [SceneSeer](https://www.youtube.com/@sceneseer8871) - another US-based startup focused on potential Computer Vision technology and applications. I focused on Scene Understanding and OCR during this period.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from [HCMUTE](https://fme.hcmute.edu.vn/ArticleId/bffdb6e0-12cc-4263-921f-c1e0f72cdfb5/introduction-to-mechatronics-department), where my thesis work focused on Image Classification, Neuralnet Explanability and the real-time integration with Mechatronics System.
